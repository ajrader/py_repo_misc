# Here's the new way to do it with ibm_db, much easier than below

# I'd suggest adding the below to your .bashrc file
export IBM_DB_HOME=/opt/IBM/db2/V9.7
pip install ibm_dm




###########  BELOW CODE IS JUST FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ########






This uses PyDB2, which seems to be broken on PyPi right now.

To install:

export http_proxy="http://ALIAS:PASSWORD@in00pxy1.opr.statefarm.org:8000"
wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/pydb2/pydb2/PyDB2_1.1.1-1/PyDB2_1.1.1-1.tar.gz
tar -xvf PyDB2_1.1.1-1.tar.gz        
chmod -R +wrx PyDB2_1.1.1
cd PyDB2_1.1.1

# Now you have to edit the setup.py file in 
# order to make it use the right libraries
# edit setup.py and change line 82 from

    for path in ['lib', 'lib32', 'lib64']:

# change that line to:

    for path in ['lib64']:

# Save your changes and exit
# run the install and install into your user directory
python2.7 setup.py install --user

# We have to tell Python to look in the right place before running anything
export  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/IBM/db2/V9.7/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


# Probably a good idea to add that line to your ~/.bashrc file

Now you can run the demo!
